<h3>TIP: Does the criterion have these helpful characteristics?</h3>
<ol>
<li>Is noncontroversial
<li>Can be evaluated (subjectively)
<li>Uses positive language (what is wanted rather than what is not wanted)
<li>Is relevant to the context
<li>Is operational (can in principle be made to happen)
<li>Applies to everyone (this is a need that everyone can recognize, not just one person’s need)
<li>Doesn’t have a specific outcome (as long as it’s noncontroversial, this is the least important characteristic)  
</ol>
